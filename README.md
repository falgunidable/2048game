# 2048game
Based on the functionality of 2048 game, lists are formed, first with a single list and then with 5 rows and 5 columns, Lists in list.
The assignment revolves around the merging of tiles, which is the main aim of the assignment. The challenging part where I got stuck in the assignment was the merging of numbers. Thinking about the conditions and then applying where to iterate was a bit challenging. Inserting zeroes in places where spaces were left, in order to show that the numbers have been merged and their spaces have been occupied by the zeroes was interesting and a good design to initiate. While testing the program with multiple lists, in order to print them simultaneously as a single list could do was an issue. Overall I did like the functioning of my program as I got to know the working of 2048 game by using lists and tried matching the logic of the game as close as possible.
